# Deployment steps
## Clone the Repo

* First, you will need to clone the code repo:

`git clone https://xxxxxx`

`cd aws-quant-infra/`

`git checkout cdk-deployment`

`cd deployment/cdk`

* To list the available stacks, do:

`cdk ls`

* To deploy all the stacks, do:

Follow the prompts, for instance entering "y" to continue and deploy the stack(s). The process can take a couple of hours to complete.
